When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

There are multiple reasons that your local copy could be lost.
For example your computer could be stolen or the hard drive could fail.
It is a good idea to have an "offsite" master copy.

Also you or others could access that remote master copy from other computers.

Having the remote master ensures it is safe and available.
